> Make (Semantic) Web content collaboratively editable through CRDTs and a dedicated hypermedia controls vocabulary.

We introduce this vocabulary for describing interactions with CRDT-based resources hosted in Solid Pods, which allows software clients to discover at run-time the required means for collaboratively editing the resources. You can use this Collaborative Linked Data Chrome Extension to consume the discription and makes the Web blog's content and its Linked Data annotations collaboratively editablebthrough CRDTs ([Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs), [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge)).

## Features

- **Collaborative Resource Description Ontology (CRDO):** Describe Web resources with hypermedia controls to enable collaboration on your website
- **Collaborative Linked Data Extension:** Users with this extensions can comsume the CRDO and collaborate in real-time on the Web content and Linked Data annotations of that content.
- **Use with Solid Pods:** If you use Solid Pods to store your data and description you can keep full control and add access control for readers and collaborators
